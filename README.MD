# simpleCarousel.js
A simple and very useful carousel of itens made by pure javascript.

<br/> // - - - Features - - - //

simpleCarousel.js has two javascript modules: "autoCarousel.js" and "manualCarousel.js". 
- autoCarousel.js:
<br/> The first script makes the carousel "spin", in other words, it changes the current itens that are beeing displayed. 
- manualCarousel.js:
<br/> The other script is about the "manual" part of the code, it is responsible for the buttons that also change the current display but obviously, they do it manually.


<br/> // - - - About the Idea - - - //

It was inspired by my frustation of not finding simple carousels that were beginner-friendly or even just tutorials teaching them. So I've come with an ideia for this lacking on the community: "simpleCarousel.js".
<br/> Actually I am a beginner myself, so if you have useful knowledge please make a note.
<br/> The ideia was make it simple so everyone could not only copy, but truly understand the concept and afterwards make it on your own.


<br/> // - - - About the Carousel - - - //

It was made in a way that you could change all the css and html (except the carousel structure and the attributes) so you can customize in your on way and you wont be blocked in pre molded designs.
